            <description>It's the go to place for all Drexel students!. Decent food good drinks. Best place in center city area. Cheap and easily accessible via car, walk, and bike. Delivers as well as pickup available. Pizza is great. Very happy with service. Delivery sleeps sometimes. I hate the delivery guy. He always asks for a tip. I live less than 20 feet away. Go away. I don't like him at all. Akshay likes big butts and he can't lie. He is a bad person. I dislike him.</description>
